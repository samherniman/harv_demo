Landowners, foresters and governments can reap huge benefits from modern data-based forest analytics and digitization.

The should act as a walk though of some of the many insights that are possible from from remote sensing technologies in the forestry sector.

::::: cr-section
Remote sensing techniques enable the collection of habitat and structural data from an environment without needing to send fieldworkers to conduct in-situ field campaigns. @cr-rs

This allows methods to have more standardization over space and time, cover wider areas, and are often more economically efficient.

Airborne laser scanning (ALS), also know as airborne lidar, allow us to quickly and efficiently collect structural profiles of a forest. These data can be used to analyse the health, carbon sequestration potential, and biodiversity of an area @cr-als

With analysis of ALS point clouds, we are able to see through the canopy of the trees and visualize the ground @cr-dtm
